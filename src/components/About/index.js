                    My name is Nicholas Cecchin and I am studying Computer Science & Software Engineering at the
                    University of Windsor. I am currently in my second year of studies and have a graduation
                    date of April 2026. I am also enrolled in the COOP program and actively searching for an internship/COOP
                    position.

                I have a few hobbies I like to do in my free time. Some of which include working on projects such as this website,
                    learning new skills such as different programming languages, and flying planes (I am currently pursuing my private pilot license).
